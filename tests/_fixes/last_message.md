I'm attaching a grepped text dump of the specific PDF I've been trying to extract with that complex argument (that's now actually coming from a "file:" text file argument). This should clearly indicate the pages where each pattern is found, and show exactly how many pages (70) have to be the total extraction, with the correct number of pages matching each comma-separated (line-separated in the text file) argument, and coming out in the proper order (if written to a new single PDF file). 

If the cities test can't simulate finding these exact results with that complex argument, update it. That is what needs to absolutely succeed before we can consider anything to be fixed. Note the broken Naknek patterns due to the OCR-ing in Acrobat, and the missing comma in one of the Sitka patterns. This is why there are some "OR" arguments in the list. And of course the Sitka pattern is on all the 70 pages, so the other cities have to be rejected in order to actually find the relevant Sitka pages. Thus the complex OR + AND NOT final argument.
